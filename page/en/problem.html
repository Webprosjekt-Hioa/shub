                            There is lots of information to digest when studying at a university. New information is distributed from teachers and faculty to the student body every day. The students need to stay on top of this constant information flow and are therefore relying on good information channels. In HiOA we have at least seven different information channels. This is too many information channels to keep track of, and it’s here the problem starts. When you get your obligatory tasks in one site, feedback on your essays by E-mail, and the time table on a different site again, it’s starts to get confusing. We have asked over a hundred students, and the fact is, we need change now.

                                We made a survey consisting of five questions. The survey was conducted in November 2017, among 100 different HiOA students, from different areas of study. We explained that this survey was made to back up our claims about the HIOA’s information channels was too many, and that it didn’t work as good as it should. Here are our results:

                                In the graph above we see the results of which year the different students were attending. The idea about this question, is to map out how many students form each year that was attending the survey. As you can see, it was a big group of students from year one to three, but a minimal group of master students.

                                This graph shows which of the different information channels the students are using. We can see that the three main information channels are Fronter, stud.hioa.no and Facebook. 96% of people asked use Fronter, while over 50% use Facebook, student mail and stud.hioa. All of the asked students used more than one channel, with the average number of channel being three. However, as can be seen on the pie chart below, most of the students think that it’s ineffective with this many channels of information.
