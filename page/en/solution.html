                                The solution that will solve this problem is called StudentHub. Its main functionality is to gather data from the different information channels in one place.

                            <p>
                                The interface consists of a user-friendly menu and a news feed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the menu the user can manually access the information they are looking for and check for notifications. The buttons on the menu reveal information from Fronter, student mail, schedule and assignments respectively, in addition to a button for settings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The news feed displays announcements from your teachers or from the school and will also alert upcoming due dates. The feed will prioritize urgent due dates followed by the most recent announcements.

                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    StudentHubâ€™s interface is universally designed for all users for both computer and mobile devices. StudentHub is not only available as a website but also as an application, this makes it possible to work with wearable devices such as smart watches.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To make StudentHub truly universal we have implemented an interface which is not only responsive and works on different devices and screens, but is also built up to be easy to use for people with handicaps. As such we have implemented high contrast, and the ability to magnify the text on the website.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Today more and more students are using new devices sutch as smartwatches to keep track of their information. With StudentHub on your wrist you will be able to check your new notifications and newsfeed on the go.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Students living an active lifestyle can still keep track of their progress and notifications even without being near a computer or smartphone. So even if you tend to forget to bring your smartphone or computer, you will never miss out on important informaiton.

                                <p>
                                    We believe that StudentHub would increase students satisfaction, at HiOA or others schools, and make their life a lot simpler. They will no longer have to struggle to find the information they need to complete their tasks. This would not only help the current students, but also future students.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to give students a better platform for receiving information, we think it would also improve students ability to plan their school weeks and upcoming assignments, so that due dates does not come as a surprise or are missed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We think StudentHub will improve students performance both academically and socially and be a valuable asset to any student.
                                </p>
