                        University is full of information and different information channels. In HIOA we have a total of seven different information channels. This is too many information channels to keep track of, and it’s here the problem starts. When you get your obligatory tasks in one site, feedback on your essays on a student mail, and the time table on a different site again, it’s starts to get confusing. We have asked over a hundred students, and the fact is, we need change now.

                            We made a survey consisting of five questions. The survey was conducted in November 2017 among 100 different HIOA students, from different areas of study. We explained that this survey was made to back up our claims about the HIOA’s information channels was too many, and that it didn’t work as good as it should. Here are our results:

                            Here we see the results of witch year the different students were attending. The idea about this question, is to map out how many students form each year that was attending the survey. As you can see, it was a big group of students from year one to three, but a minimal group of master students.

                            This bar shows witch of the different information channels the students are using. We can see that the three main information channels are Fronter, stud.hioa.no and facebook. Almost every student uses every single one of the information channels, but as you can see on the pie chart below, most of the students think that it’s ineffective with these many channels of information.
