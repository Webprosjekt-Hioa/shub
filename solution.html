                            The website that will solve this problem is called Studenthub. Its main functionality is to gather data from the different information channels in one place.

                        <p>
                            The interface consists of a user-friendly menu and a news feed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the menu the user can manually access the information they are looking for and check for notifications. The buttons on the menu reveal information from fronter, student mail, schedule and assignments respectively, in addition to a button for settings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The news feed displays announcements from your teachers or from the school and will also alert upcoming due dates. The feed will prioritize urgent due dates followed by the most recent announcements. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="article-w">
                        <h2>
                            Accessible to all users 
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The interface is universally designed for all users on both computer and mobile. This is not just because the interface is simple and responsive, but also because options for high contrast and bigger text give access to users with visual handicaps. A language option will also be present for users of different nationalities. If you use a screen reader, then it will read the text in a sensible order and explain images as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These configurations allow equal access to all students, making sure none are unprivileged using the website. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="article-w">
                        <h2>What Studenthub can accomplish</h2>
                        <p>
                            If Studenthub is implemented at HiOA or other schools, then we believe the life for students will become a lot easier. They will no longer struggle finding the information they are looking for and don’t have to rely on sources like Facebook. No due dates will be missed, and assignments will be notified sooner.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a very important improvement as college students are more independent than high schoolers and require as much assistance as possible from information channels. With Studenthub, current students can study more efficiently with easily accessible information and freshmen will struggle less getting used to system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This will in total improve the students’ impression of the school and make the surrounding environment more welcoming.
